DrawLevels
==========

DrawLevels is a package to enable quickly drawing a level scheme and easilly allowing for the
slow encorporation of additional levels. The idea is that as a project goes forwards you can 
keep appending the file with new levels and transitions. This should be a lot easier than some
of the more fiddly methods that exist. It allows for exact level schemes to be easily drawn.

There is a example level scheme included in the file 'Example.py'.

This is probably not ready for use in publication yet - but this should change with further updates.

Install
=======

To install use:

	pip install DrawLevels

This should give you the most up-to-date version of the package.

A note for installation - this requires the module 'pycairo' in order to render the image.
If not automatically installed, this can also be installed using:
	
	pip install pycairo

Thanks for using my maiden package! Enjoy!
