DrawLevels
==========

DrawLevels is a package to enable quickly drawing a level scheme and easilly allowing for the
slow encorporation of additional levels. The idea is that as a project goes forwards you can 
keep appending teh file with new levels and transitions. This should be a lot easier than some
of the more fiddly methods that exist. It allows for exact level schemes to be easily drawn.

This is probably not ready for use in publication yet - but this should change with further updates.
