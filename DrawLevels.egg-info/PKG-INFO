Description: DrawLevels
        ==========
        
        DrawLevels is a package to enable quickly drawing a level scheme and easilly allowing for the
        slow encorporation of additional levels. The idea is that as a project goes forwards you can 
        keep appending the file with new levels and transitions. This should be a lot easier than some
        of the more fiddly methods that exist. It allows for exact level schemes to be easily drawn.
        
        There is a example level scheme included in the file 'Example.py'.
        
        This is probably not ready for use in publication yet - but this should change with further updates.
        
        Install
        =======
        
        To install use:
        
        	pip install DrawLevels
        
        This should give you the most up-to-date version of the package.
        
        A note for installation - this requires the module 'pycairo' in order to render the image.
        If not automatically installed, this can also be installed using:
        	
        	pip install pycairo
        
        Thanks for using my maiden package! Enjoy!
